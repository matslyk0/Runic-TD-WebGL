Runic TD, a fantasy tower defense game made in Unity3D. 

The objective of the game is to place various elemental wizards to stop the invasion from reaching the Fortress. The game only requires left clicking making it very accessible. There are also 3 difficult levels to choose from, so you can tailor your playthrough to your tastes. Each elemental wizard has its own unique attribute, as well as 2 upgrade paths. Pick the top path to enhance this unique attribute further or pick the bottom path to sacrifice this attribute in exchange for a different kind of power. If you like an element or two more than others, you can progress your Fortress Runes, which are global buffs to specific wizard types. These runes are presented as a skill tree, and at the end of each elemental path, you must choose whether to further the respective element's unique attribute, or pick a more general upgrade. There are 2 additional paths in the Fortress Runes that increase your income. In Runic TD, enemies do not drop currency. Instead, you earn a passive income that you can increase to a certain extent. As such, you need to be critical and selective with your purchases.

The colours of the elements are as follows: Earth - Orange, Fire - Red, Wind - Green, Water - Blue. Every enemy has specific elemental weaknesses and resistances, so pick a variety of wizards to deal with the enemies most effectively. The elemental advantages are as follows: Earth -> Water -> Fire -> Wind -> Earth. Intuitively, the disadvantages are the reverse of this. Earth is weak against Wind, Wind is weak against Fire, and so on. As you progress through the levels, you will progress through the story of the Runewards defending themselves from the Kingdom. If you're interested in the lore, click on the button in the corner of the level selection menu.

We used the enemy pathing tutorial as the base of the script PathManager and Enemy script. We used the video to learn how to implement the enemy pathing feature then with that as base we improvised and modified the enemy script to allow it to perform much more.
The tower AI tutorial was used to get an idea on how to setup a basic tower prefab including tower rotation towards a target and basic implementation of close targetting. We then further built upon this by adding different kinds of targeting options, such as target first and last.
As for the wave spawning tutorial it was used to get an idea on how to sequence the events in when spawning waves of enemies. We further developed and changed the features to allow for multi path spawning and wave customisation in the unity inspector.
