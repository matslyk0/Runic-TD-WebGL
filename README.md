Runic TD, a fantasy tower defense game made in Unity3D.

The objective is to place towers on tiles to protect the castle at the end of the road from incoming waves of enemies.

We used the enemy pathing tutorial as the base of the script PathManager and Enemy script. We used the video to learn how to implement the enemy pathing feature then with that as base we improvised and modified the enemy script to allow it to perform much more. The tower AI tutorial was used to get an idea on how to setup a basic tower prefab including tower rotation towards a target and basic implementation of close targetting. We then further built upon this by adding different kinds of targeting options, such as target first and last. As for the wave spawning tutorial it was used to get an idea on how to sequence the events in when spawning waves of enemies. We further developed and changed the features to allow for multi path spawning and wave customisation in the unity inspector.
